Synthetic City: Simulating Urban Growth and Dynamics.

Project Overview
Objective: Create a Python-based simulation to generate synthetic data representing the growth and dynamics of a virtual city. Use the data to visualize urban development, population movement, and infrastructure expansion in an engaging way.
Project Components
1. Data Generation: City Growth Simulation
•	Generate a City Map: Creating a grid or geospatial map where each cell represents a city block.
o	Using NumPy to create a matrix for land type (residential, industrial, commercial, parks, etc.).
o	Simulate terrain (e.g., rivers, hills, and flatlands) using Perlin noise from the noise library.
•	Population Growth:
o	Initializing starting populations for residential blocks.
o	Simulate population growth using random factors (birth rates, migration) and events (economic booms, natural disasters).
•	Infrastructure Expansion:
o	Add transportation networks (roads, railways).
o	Using graph libraries like NetworkX to model and optimize traffic flow.
2. Dynamic Events
•	Add real-world-inspired dynamic events:
o	Randomized economic changes (e.g., gentrification, industrial booms).
o	Natural disasters (e.g., floods, earthquakes).
o	Policy decisions (e.g., building parks, zoning regulations).
3. Data Storage
•	Storing simulation data over time using:
o	Pandas DataFrames for tabular data.
o	JSON/CSV for exporting simulation states.

Data Visualization
1. Animated City Map
•	Using Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize city maps at different time intervals.
•	Incorporate animations using Matplotlib.animation or Plotly for interactive maps.
2. Interactive Dashboards
•	Creating an interactive dashboard with Dash or Streamlit:
o	Display key metrics (e.g., population, pollution, GDP).
o	Show graphs of population growth, traffic density, etc.
o	Include a slider to explore historical data over time.
3. Data Insights
•	Visualizing correlations:
o	Heatmaps of land usage vs. population density.
o	Trends of city growth over time.
•	Analyzing the effects of policy changes or disasters on city dynamics.

Unique Features
1.	Customizable City Parameters: Which allows users to tweak variables (e.g., initial population, land distribution).
2.	Random Seeds: Generating unique cities every time based on random seeds.



My Stretched Goals
•	Machine Learning: Train models to predict future city growth or optimize infrastructure placement.
•	Augmented Reality: Visualize the city in 3D using PyVista or Unity (via Python bindings).
•	Integration with Real Data: Combine synthetic data with real-world city data for comparison.
